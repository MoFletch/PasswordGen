## Introduction
#### The Challenge requested the student create a password generator using best practices learned in Module 3, as well as integrating previous learnings.  This includes Javascript, HTML and CSS, ensuring use of new learnings to include random selection, if and while statements and other basic Javascript functions.

## Contributing
#### This is an individual (not group) project.  Students can contribute to the project by completing Module 3 lessons and using learnings to complete the assignment, optimizing code.

## Help
#### If encountering any roadblocks, the student has a variety of support options.  The challenge required the use of coding that hasn't been taught yet and is first being explained in the next week's lessons. The official documentation was too vague in some cases, and too complex in others presenting options that included many new unknown elements and coding that the student has not been taught yet and unable to utilize at this beginner stage of her education.
